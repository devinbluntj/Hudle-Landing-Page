# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section solution

This is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size (mobile and desktop)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page (desktop)



## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the first time that I'm using the Mobile-first workflow to build a web page. I can't judge if it's easier than building the desktop first because this is the first time that I'm actually learning it but using it on this project seems to be the more easier approach to RWD to me. I also learned more about CSS GRID AND FLEXBOX as I applied both to building this project.


### Continued development

I will learn more about Mobile-first workflow and CSS GRID.
